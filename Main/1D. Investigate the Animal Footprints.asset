  m_Name: 1D. Investigate the Animal Footprints
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'You pay close attention to the animal footprints, which look eerily
    familiar.  Almost like the family dog''s after he''d run inside from playing
    out in the mud on his early morning walk-abouts.  Following these prints lead
    around the corner to the door which goes to the basement stairs, but while walking
    down the steps 3 of the stairs open up and you fall into a pool of deadly piranhas. 
    I''m not sure why we''re defining these piranhas as "deadly", considering any
    pool of piranhas would be a less than ideal situation to be in.


    Either
    way, you''re dead.

    over")'
