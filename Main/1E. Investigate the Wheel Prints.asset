  m_Name: 1E. Investigate the Wheel Prints
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'You look closely at the wheel marks... interesting.  Following these
    up the stairs they pick up off the floor then roll then pick back up off the
    floor again leading into the room on the left but the door is locked.  This didn''t
    use to have a large steel vault door on it, how long have we been sleeping for? 
    There is a panel on the side that takes a numerical input, possibly a passcode
    to unlock the door?  M scans the panel and 3 of the numbers appear to be pressed
    with little smudges on them, 2, 7, & 9.


    What would you like to do?


    1.)
    Try to guess the code

    2.) investigate the room we''re in now

    3.) Use
    force.  Wire up explosives from the mine to blow the hinges off this thing'
