  storyText: "Smart move!  You walk past the Aston Martin and continue walking to
    the mines.  Upon arriving you realize you've yet to clear out a significant amount
    of brush.  That's ok, Agent L raises her wrist and unclips a knife that she uses
    to hack away at the brush.  This takes awhile but you're able to clear a path
    into the mines and recall the crate of explosives being a little ways in.  There
    is a mining cart with the label \"Snow County RailCo\" on the left, which you
    could use to ride to the explosives or take the path to the right.  \n\nWhat
    to do?\n\n1.) Get in Mining Cart\n2.) Walk down path "
