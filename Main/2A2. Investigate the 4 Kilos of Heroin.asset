  m_Name: 2A2. Investigate the 4 Kilos of Heroin
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: "You pickup one of the Kilos of heroin but as you pick it up you realize
    that these have been sitting here untouched since killing Kananga with the gas
    pellets in 1973.  The corner of the paper kilo bag disintegrates and out spills
    a Kilo of heroin into the air.   \n\nGood thing you've built up your Opioid tolerance
    over the years. Too bad an old Cannon that was stored hanging from the ceiling
    just happened to fall on your head.\n\n1.) You're Dead, go back"
