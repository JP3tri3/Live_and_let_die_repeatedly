  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'You decide to scan the door for clues, M raises his wrist to the door.
    The Omega watch glinting in the morning sun, there hasn''t been a chance to use
    the upgrades that Q implemented as a "Christmas Present".  He likes to call it
    a gift but there''s always some reason for these $200,000 upgrades.  The watch
    face starts pulsing with scanning lasers across the door frame and surrounding
    area which highlights two sets of footprints.  One set is clearly from an animal,
    possibly a 100 pound pitbull.  The other set looks almost like a small set of
    wheels.


    What to do?

    1.) Investigate the animal footprints

    2.)
    Investigate the wheel prints'
