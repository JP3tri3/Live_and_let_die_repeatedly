  storyText: 'You pickup the Bell-Trexton Jetpack, feeling almost as rusty on how
    to fly this thing as it looks.  After putting it on you look at the buttons on

    as the engines roar to life... you take off and smash into the ceiling at 120kph.


    This
    wasn''t meant to be flown inside.
