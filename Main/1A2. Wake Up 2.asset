  storyText: "You get out of bed and walk into the living room where there are two
    ammo boxes.  Someone left these here.  Someone has been inside, you notice the
    door is slightly ajar.  There is a combination lock on each crate, you could
    probably just cut the lock off but what if there is a tripwire?  You'll need
    to find the combination.\n\nWhat would you like to do?\n\n1.) Scan the door for
    clues\n2.) It's too early for this, let's make a cup of coffee first\x03"
