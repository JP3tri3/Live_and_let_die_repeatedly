  storyText: 'You carefully walk down the path and see a box of explosives labeled
    "ANFO" on the side.  Previous high explosives training helps you recall that
    this stands for Ammonium Nitrate, Fuel Oil.. this should work.  The only problem
    is that it is across a vast opening in the mine floor.  You do see a small bridge
    tied up on the other side that looks like its used to cross this opening along
    with an old Bell-Trexton Jetpack laying on the floor.


    1.) Go back and use
    the mining cart

    2.) Take out the Walther PPK and carefully shoot the rope
    holding the bridge to try and drop it into place

    3.) Use the Bell-Trexton
    Jetpack to get across'
